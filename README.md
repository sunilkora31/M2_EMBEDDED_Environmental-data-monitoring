Project Description:

In todayâ€™s environmental system, many parameter measurements are required to monitor and control for the good quality and productivity of plants. But to get the desired results there are some very important factors which come into play like Temperature, Humidity, Light and Water, which are necessary for a better plant growth. Keeping these parameters in mind I have built an Automatic Controlling and Monitoring System over GSM module using MC . This system is very efficient for growing good quality plants. The other important part of this project is that it is fully automatic.
These days GSM Module is widely used in in this system. Here in this project by using GSM Module we can keep information about the effects of climate on plants. The system shall also demonstrate climatic changes which affects the plant in its productivity and quality etc. The main purpose of coming up this project is to build an Automatic system Monitoring in which GSM module sends the information about Temperature, Humidity, Light intensity, Soil moisture and status of appliances (Fan, Sprays, Artificial Lights and Water pump) that are connected with circuit for controlling Green House effects or Green House parameters (Temperature, Humidity, Light intensity and Water supply for plants).

### Garden environment Monitoring System ###

Smart Gardening system implementation that includes :
* autonomous irrigation
* environment detection e.g. soil moisture, surrounding temporature, lighting conditions
* easy-to-scale multi-station architecture
* logging mechanism (will work with server-side code & database, for further data analysis)
