Research:
Environmental pollution is an international serious, acute, health and social problem that humans are responsible for. Rapid technology evolution could provide us solutions to predict and monitor environmental parameters and thus minimize or even eliminate environmental pollution. Using a wireless sensor network (WSN) and an Internet of Things (IoT) implementation, we can create an eco-friendly and controlled environment. This project presents an embedded and standalone system that can monitor, store and analyse environmental data as well as calculate energy consumption in specific settings. Information is available via a web application with central management abilities. Our appliance can work standalone as well as part of a smart ICT grid of appliances. The system aims to determine and designate environmental spaces, in which human activities could be harmful. More specific, it can be used at world cultural heritage and archaeological places, building, constructions where allowance of human intervention is prohibited or very limited. Collecting and analyzing data can help us estimate the environmental consequences of human actions. 

4W's 1'H:

Why:
 The concept of "quality of life" has not yet been defined in a specific and uniform manner, in result there are still many conceptual uncertainties. Undoubtedly, one of the main factors which affect human life is natural environment that is considered to determine a major extent to quality of life. 

What:
The main factors which affect human life is natural environment that is considered to determine a major extent to quality of life.

Where:
Our WSN system aims to monitor spaces, analyze collected data, and determine and designate environmental spaces, in which human activities could be harmful. More specific, it can be used at world cultural heritage and archaeological places, buildings, constructions where allowance of human intervention is prohibited or very limited. Collecting and analyzing data could help us estimate the environmental consequences of human actions. 

When:
This project is going to be deployed on 02/12/2021.

How:
This project We have designed and implemented an embedded and standalone system that can monitor, store and analyse environmental data as well as calculate energy consumption in a specific environment. Our system design and implementation covers both hardware and software issues.

SWOT Analysis
Strength
The ultimate strength to Collecting and analyzing data could help us estimate the environmental consequences of human actions..

Weakness
Our system can be used to determine and designate environmental spaces, in which human activities could be
harmful. In that respect, it is appropriate for world cultural heritage and archaeological places, buildings, constructions where allowance of human intervention is prohibited or very limited.

Opportunity
Our research has presented an embedded and standalone system that can monitor, store and analyse environmental data as well as calculate energy consumption in specific settings. The implemented WSN system and the supporting software can work standalone as well as part of a smart ICT grid of appliances and offers the following services: monitor abiotic elements and store data, perform energy profiling of spaces, partially intervene in the operating state of the interconnected.appliances and calculate room’s total electricity consumption. 

Threats
  (a) Recommend best settings for a given situation. 
  (b) Adjust appliance’s operation to fit recommended settings.
  (c) Informs the user about dangerous levels.
  (d) make use of APIXU API (weather API) to get external environmental conditions, e.g.temperature, humidity, if it is day/night, etc

  High level requirments:
  The space, must include a microcontroller. More specifically, the microcontroller must be an ATMEGA with sensors (temperature, humidity, CO, CT) and some interconnected appliances. The software requests data from the Arduino. The installation must have a LAN connected to the internet. 

  Low level requirments:
  The user must be able to intervene in connected appliances’ operation state, Admin must populate database with room information (country, city, building name, room name, latitude-longitude coordinates, room usage, area size (square meters), humidity/temperature optimal values, installed sensors, installed appliances) before room is ready for profiling.
